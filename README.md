AKTEvaluation
=============

Our new hire PHP evaluation code.

Overview
=============
Develop a customer facing application that will take a __domestic (US) phone number__ of any format as input and save it to a MySQL database.

The application should accept these formats:
+1555-555-555, 1-555-555-5555, 1(555)-555-5555, 555-5555, 555.5555...etc

The database should be setup to accept a standardized format of the phone numbers inserted to be used later.

Any technology stack may be used. The use of the internet is acceptable. 

Please chronicle your design and development process in some form, to us the process is just as important as the final product for this demo.

On Completion
==============

Please commit the final files to a new branch using your full firstname and last initial within this repo.
