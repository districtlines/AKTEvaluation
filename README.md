AKTEvaluation - Back-End Developer
=============

Our new hire PHP evaluation code.

Overview
=============
Develop a customer facing application that will take a __domestic (US) phone number__ of any format as input and save it to a MySQL database.

The codebase should be setup to accept the input and sanitize so that the data can be uniform. The idea is to generate a standardized format that will be useful for any type of output.

The final application should be able to accept these strings.

This does not need to be built on a complete MVC framework. It should be built with OOP practices using classes. The base files are there, but feel free to change them to fit your needs.

Please chronicle your design and development process in some form, to us the process is just as important as the final product for this demo. Commenting code is a plus!

Please log your time of development and include that in the comments.

On Completion
==============

Please commit the final files to a new branch using your full firstname and last initial within this repo.
