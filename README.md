# AKTEvaluation -  Front-End Developers

This evaluation will test your HTML, CSS, Javascript and minor PHP/MySQL chops.

### Installation:
* Download this branch as a ZIP.
* This evaluation uses PHP so you will need to load it in an environment that runs PHP 5.3 or greater. So use your favorite server or local MAMP/WAMP install.
* Uncompress the ZIP within your environment.
* Run the index.php. Instructions are within the project. Keep track of time!
* Good luck! Use the internet and other resources if you get stuck. No shame in googling.

### Develiverables
* Once you are completed with the evaluation. Zip up the whole project and send it back to AKT. Please include in the email how long it took you to complete the project.
